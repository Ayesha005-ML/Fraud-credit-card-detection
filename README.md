# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project uses a Deep Neural Network to Identify fraudulent transactions.
## Week 01: Data preprocessing

## Week 02: Model Architecture 

## Week 03: Model Tuning 

## Week 04: Final Evaluation

Accuracy: 98.51% (overall correctness)

Precision: High (Model's ability to not label a legit transaction as fraud)

Recall: Optimized(Model's ability to find all actual fraud cases)

Final Loss: 0.0783
